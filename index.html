        <p class="lead mb-4">When the COVID-19 crisis hit, many kids were cut off from their education.  I took a senior leadership position managing 30 student teachers in an organization called Bridge Road International, helping almost 200 kids receive e-learning. I both managed a large team of student teachers, and taught English classes myself.  In the same organization, I also participated in a program to equip doctors with medically-approved face screens when there was a shortage, and personally assembled and delivered 250 to Washington Hospital doctors.<br><br>
I was part of the generation that saw Apple change the world, and that vision of unending waves of new technologies continuously improving peopleâ€™s lives has always excited me. The idea influences my thoughts about my education and career in the future. I canâ€™t think of anything better than to be where business and technology meet.
In the summer of 2018 I had an opportunity to take a marketing internship in Silicon Valley at Philips AOC Envision, and I could not have been more ecstatic. I was a kid in a candy store, learning about the companyâ€™s planned products, how they worked together with technologies from legendary companies like AMD and NVIDIA, and finding out before any of my friends about upcoming games from Ubisoft and Blizzard. For three months I was in my own world, fascinated by how the company was run, the people, and mostly the up close experience with new technologies. As a kid with years of gaming experience, I really understood the market that the company was selling into, and my recommendations by the marketing team. It was perfect.   
Over the course of the summer, the team entrusted me with creating content for product listings on Amazon, asked me to evaluate gaming monitors, and ate up my social media and gaming event recommendations. I worked on an e-tail market competition review. But For a summer I had a chance to really contribute to bringing new technology into peoplesâ€™ lives, which had captivated me since my childhood. And now I have a better understanding of what I can accomplish, and where I want my education and career to go.
<br><br>
 I spent one summer as an intern at a Silicon Valley tech company called Philips AOC/ Envision, where I learned the PC and gaming business.  Envision is the sole licensee for Philips monitors and audio products in North America, and AOC is the #1 gaming monitor brand worldwide.
